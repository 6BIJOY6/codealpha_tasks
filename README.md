# Hangman Game 🎮

This is a simple **Hangman game in Python** created as part of a university/student learning project.  
The program randomly selects a word, and the player must guess it letter by letter before running out of attempts.

---

## ✅ Features

- Random word selection
- Letter-by-letter guessing
- Tracks guessed letters
- Limited attempts (6 tries)
- Win or lose message

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project demonstrates:

- `lists`
- `random.choice()`
- `while` loops
- `if-elif-else` statements
- `input()` and `print()`

# Stock Portfolio Tracker 📈

This is a simple **Python program** that allows users to track their stock investments.  
The program uses predefined stock prices, calculates the total investment value based on user input, and can optionally save the portfolio summary to a text file.

This project was created for learning purposes as part of a university/student programming task.

---

## ✅ Features

- Shows available stocks with current prices
- Allows user to select stocks and enter quantities
- Calculates individual investment values
- Calculates total portfolio investment
- Option to save summary to a file (`portfolio_summary.txt`)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project demonstrates:

- Dictionaries (`stock_prices`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- User input handling
- Exception handling (`try/except`)
- File handling (`open`, `write`)
- Basic calculations

# Basic Rule-Based Chatbot

A very simple rule-based chatbot written in Python.  
It responds to a few fixed user inputs such as `hello`, `how are you`, and `bye` using `if-elif` conditions, a loop, and functions.

This project is intended as a beginner exercise to practise:
- `if-elif-else` statements  
- Functions  
- Loops  
- Input/Output with `input()` and `print()`

---

## Features

- Text-based conversation in the terminal.
- Handles the following inputs:
  - `hello` → `Hi!`
  - `how are you` → `I'm fine, thanks!`
  - `bye` → `Goodbye!` and exits the program.
- For any other input, the chatbot replies:
  - `Sorry, I don't understand.`
